# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## A tad bit about me

I am, first and foremost, a Chemist and Materials Scientist. I also like coding, and I know Js (& Html, css) and Python well. I used to program in C#, Matlab and Java quite a bit, though not anymore, and I have some knowledge of other languages (ASM, C, bash, powershell, AHK), but I'm not proficient in them.

Publicly, I've coded a number of basic websites ([checkers](https://github.com/TheBooker66/Checkers), [minesweeper](https://github.com/TheBooker66/MineSweeper), etc.), a [Whatsapp bot](https://github.com/ArielYat/Whatsapp-bot-Project) (which during its peak was used by more than a thousand concurrent users) and as of now am the sole maintainer of [Technion Plus Plus (Technion++, for short)](https://github.com/TheBooker66/Technion-Plus-Plus).
